# Derpl
A expression parser and execution librarly for dot net.

## About
This exists becauase someone was talking about formula parsing from user
input and evaluating it in .NET.  I hadn't experimented with this in
several years and decided to implement something and this is the result.
It isn't particularly well designed or implemented but it was
interesting to build.
